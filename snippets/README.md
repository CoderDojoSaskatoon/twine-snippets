# Snippets

## Guide

These snippets generally work by creating a new passage in your Twine story, pasting the snippet code inside the new passage and running the code in your story passages using `<%= window.story.render("PASSAGE NAME") %>`

Again, as stated in the project README, you need to use the Snowman 2.X story format for these snippets to work.
