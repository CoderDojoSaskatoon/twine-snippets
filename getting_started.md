# Getting Started

## Download and Setup
Start by downloading the latest version of Twine from [twinery.org](https://twinery.org/). If you are using a Mac, you may get a warning upon opening the newly installed application, go to System Preferences -> Security & Privacy to enable the application.

These snippets require that your Twine story be in the Snowman 2.x format. To change your story format use the pop-up menu in the lower-left of the app and choose the "Change Story Format" option.
